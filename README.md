## About K8 (me)
So. where ware we.. oh yeah i was talking to you about why did i create this project lets talk about how. <br>
well this whole thing started with me being curious about coding and well i don't have someone who could teach me coding <br>
but i knew [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) was a good place to learn stuff from and i found a lot of diffrent tutorials on Python Node.js HTML CSS styling, <br>
and i was pretty good at learning at the starting but i was kinda using Github Cop (Copilot) a lot. <br>
and i did lern some stuff like async, function, cosnt, import, module.export and a lot of diffrent things but it was slow at first<br>
but then things started to take a MASSIVE turn when i started messing things with 
```
discord.js
```
and it was quit fun on the Python side but then i started doing stuff on node.js then it started getting hard cause there was about none <br>
youtube tutorials about it's functions so i started using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and it has Improved a lot since i have been starting to use it <br>
and yes i did use chatgpt to cleanify my code a little bit since i was a bit lost but in the end it all works great <br>
and at this time im writing this README.md im still making the jump to DCB-1.2.0 and trust me it's gonna be a MASSIVE jump <br>
so where ware we yeah it was a bit hard for me to learn discord.js since i couldn't fine any good tutorils about the discord.js<br>since most of them ware jsut begginer lvl coding and i wanted a full on tutorial about discord.js and it's networking and API functions
